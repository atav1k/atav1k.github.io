This is a costly and time consuming problem for personal finances and the reason for human centric solutions we design.</p><p>To date most people wait in lines each month to pay their bills at select kiosks or banks. Thanks to local partnerships and integrations, Luka would be able to produce a "kiosk" on their phones.  </p></div></div><div class="row m-t"><div class="col-sm-12"><img src="/assets/img/luka-flow.png" class="img-responsive img-bordered"></div></div><div class="row m-b"><div class="col-sm-12"><p class="text-muted">User flow to map early release features</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><h2>Talking to users after every build</h2><p>Early on in our evaluative research, we realized that the design paradigms that we were used to differed from a general user base. Notably, the user needed much more prompting around how the app would work. This led us to focus on narrative ux, favoring clear labels over minimalism.</p><p>Our test group was also varied, accounting for the different user segments we would be targeting, from the small business owner to the individual. We realized that we would be able to serve multiple groups using a single design pattern, the "cashtag". Regardless of whether someone was paying a bill or a person, they would be interacting with a cashtag handle. We're working to extend that paradigm into conversational ui.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><h2>Rebuilding for components</h2><p>The project was originally prototyped in Material Design despite the tradeoffs. Custom styles are were problematic with existing Material Design CSS libraries so we decided to reduce the app down to its components and theme Semantic UI.</p><p>I also created a quick style guide for junior designers on the team. This would serve as starting guidelines for the company as it began to produce landing pages and marketing assets.</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-6"><img src="/assets/img/luka-component.png" class="img-responsive img-bordered"></div><div class="col-xs-6"><img src="/assets/img/luka-components.png" class="img-responsive img-bordered"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><p class="text-muted">UI components in Semantic UI</p></div></div><div class="row m-t m-b-lg"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2"><img src="/assets/img/luka-brand.png" class="img-responsive img-bordered"><p class="text-muted">Luka brand poster</p></div></div></div></section><section id="design-next" class="block"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-12"><h4 class="white">Next</h4><a href="/design/aver"><h1 class="white">Rapid credit for the emerging and mobile</h1></a></div></div></div></section><!-- != partial("_partials/footer")--><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/toolkit.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
