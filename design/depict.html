Testing mockups using Sketch Mirror is a quick way to validate design assumptions, which in this case raised some concerns. The original IA map was based on a hamburger icon navigation but the affordance of having multiple navigation options came at the cost of ease.</p><blockquote>Users rarely used the hamburger icon to engage with the different discovery methods.</blockquote><p>Going late into the night, I reordered the IA map and switched the design to a lower navigation bar with contextual upper navigation elements where needed.</p><p>Signing off on foundational elements, I designed the remaining screens and wired a functional prototype in Xcode. Testing revealed another catch.</p><blockquote>The login-signup prompted new users to signup immediately before really experiencing the product.</blockquote><p>Instead, we decided to make the account creation and login optional for a majority of features. Sketch assets were rendered for the iOS designer with written specifications on interactions, sizing etc. </p></div><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-4 m-b-md"><h3 class="m-t-0">Refreshing a brand and web application</h3><p>How do you rein in a front-end that was built incrementally so that framework is future proof? How do you update a brand that leans forward while retaining elements of its past.</p><p>I led Depict’s engineering team through a few scenarios after which we decided it was time to design a build a new front-end framework using SCSS and molecular principles. I sat down with the lead engineer and mapped all the micro and macro elements to produce the IA for the site, allowing us to focus on designing patterns for a few screens.</p><p>Concurrently, we began exploring brand identities—logo mark, word mark and color palette, collaborating with Matter Group to ensure that the identity fit with the hardware presentation. We leaned into muted salmon, peach and warm grays which carried a lifestyle aesthetic, original but muted enough to let the artwork dominate.</p><p>We quickly moved from Sketch prototypes, through sign off, into architecting the front-end in Middleman according to molecular design principles—each component referenced in a generated book.</p></div></div></div></section><footer><div class="container"><div class="row p-t"><div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-4 text-center"><svg width="100%" height="100%" viewBox="0 0 800 800" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xml:space="preserve" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;stroke-linecap:round;stroke-linejoin:round;stroke-miterlimit:1.41421;" class="w-md"><g><path d="M700,100l-600,0l300,600l300,-600Z" style="fill:#3C466E;stroke-width:20px;stroke:#3C466E;"></path><circle cx="400" cy="197.5" r="37.5" style="fill:#EBECF4;stroke-width:20px;stroke:#EBECF4;"></circle><path d="M400,700l-100,-200l-100,0l100,-200l100,200c3.25144e-11,-6.49152e-11 150,-300 150,-300l0.122948,0.245895l0.123149,-0.245895l149.754,300l-200,0l-100,200Z" style="fill:#7A819D;stroke-width:22px;stroke:#7A819D;"></path></g></svg></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 text-center"><p><small>This site was coded in Jade and Less using HarpJS with zero bloat.</small></p></div></div></div></footer><script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/toolkit.min.js"></script><script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script></body></html>
